Mathematica Notebooks for Neuroengineering/Neuroscience Modeling

This repository consists of various Mathematica notebooks that I use in my day-to-day work in order to help me understand the various neuroscience models of neural spiking that are being used by our group to model the neuron in silicon.  It also includes scripts and calculations to allow quick conversion of data that I get to circuit parameters in NeuroGrid.  Many of the notebooks implement manipulators that help with both an intuitive, conceptual understanding of the calibration process, and also the various approximate values that should be used or gotten from the calibration process.  It provides an analytical approach towards understanding what the circuit might actually be implementing.
